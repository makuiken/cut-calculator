# cut-calculator
This notebook calculates the lengths remaining from making cuts out of a user-defined board size. 

Enter in a desired cut length, the length of the boards you will be cutting from, the quantity of cut pieces you need, and the minimum size of waste you want to be left with. The result will be a python list of lengths you will remain with.
